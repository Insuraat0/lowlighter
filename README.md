# Lowlighter
Lowlighter is a free, customizable, and fully offline highlighter for research and productivity. The extension is available for Chrome and Firefox. It saves all your highlights on your computer and allows you to easily browse them on an organized dashboard. You can add notes, sort them into folders, and export them as citations.

## Use
Install the extension from the web stores listed below or from the releases page, then by default you can select text and highlight it by pressing ``Alt + S``, or automatically highlight any selected text by enabling the cursor by pressing ``Alt + Shift + S``. You can change these keybinds in the settings page by clicking on the extension icon and then ``Shortcut settings``. The icon popup allows you to also customize other options, such as the colors and folders you highlight with and into, and access the dashboard, where you can view and organize all your highlights, and export them as citations.
